# Safety, contacts, consent and supervision

[Reference index](README.md) · [API guide](../README.md)

Access shown here describes bearer metadata only. Anonymous operations can still
require installation admission, application attestation, contact proof or country
context. A bearer token does not replace ownership, feature gates or role checks.

Each entry lists recorded schemas, parameters, status codes and mutation guards.
Response metadata is not a complete list of runtime business outcomes; read the
[contract limitations](../coverage-and-limitations.md).
