# Private uploads and authorized retrieval

[Reference index](README.md) · [API guide](../README.md)

Access shown here describes bearer metadata only. Anonymous operations can still
require installation admission, application attestation, contact proof or country
context. A bearer token does not replace ownership, feature gates or role checks.

Each entry lists recorded schemas, parameters, status codes and mutation guards.
Response metadata is not a complete list of runtime business outcomes; read the
[contract limitations](../coverage-and-limitations.md).

## POST `/api/v1/uploads`

**What it does:** Accept a genuine supported file into private storage and return upload evidence; it is neither public sharing nor document approval.

**Access:** Bearer required.

**Body:** inline schema in OpenAPI; requiredness not asserted in metadata; media types: `multipart/form-data`.

| Inline body field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | `string (binary)` | File text/value for this model. The source schema does not specify a further vocabulary; server validation and the owning workflow define permitted use. |
| `contentClass` | `string` | Content class text/value for this model. The source schema does not specify a further vocabulary; server validation and the owning workflow define permitted use. |

| Recorded status | Response schema | Media types | Response headers |

## POST `/api/v1/uploads/recoverable`

**What it does:** Create an upload with durable recovery identity so an interrupted response can be reconciled.

**Access:** Bearer required.
